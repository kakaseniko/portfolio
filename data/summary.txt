    • Infinitely curious and interested in many things/ fields, hence all the different studies and jobs. This makes me a generalist who loves learning, exploring new ideas, and experimenting. Probably will never became a specialist in anything.
    • Within IT I like working with machine learning and AI the most. I really enjoy exploring new tools and solutions and find a way to use them/ apply them in a real world scenario.
