         take action to protect it and to improve its current state. It was fulfilling to apply my knowledge for a cause that I believe in. I feel like this was the 
         perfect assignment that marks the end of my studies. </br></br>
         The process included data labeling (about 10.000 images was enough to condition myself to spot Japanese knotweed everywhere I go ðŸ« ), testing different model
